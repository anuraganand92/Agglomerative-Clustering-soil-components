## Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering on Soil Component Data

### Project Description

This project focuses on performing **Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering** on a dataset containing **district names and their corresponding component percentages for soil**. The goal is to **group districts based on the similarity of their soil component percentages** using different linkage methods. The project also includes plotting a **dendrogram to visualize the clustering results** and **identifying the break line for clustering**.

### Dataset

The dataset consists of district names and their corresponding component percentages for soil. It is assumed that the dataset has been preprocessed and contains no missing data.

### Project Steps

1. **Data Cleaning**: Remove any rows with missing data from the dataset to ensure that only complete data points are considered for clustering.

2. **Data Sampling**: Randomly choose 155 data points from the dataset for the clustering task. This sampling step ensures that the clustering analysis is performed on a representative subset of the data.

3. **Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering**: Apply Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering to the sampled data using different linkage methods. Some commonly used linkage methods include:
     - Single linkage
     - Complete linkage
     - Average linkage
     - Ward linkage

4. **Clustering Comparison**: Compare the outputs of the clustering analysis using the different linkage methods. Evaluate the resulting clusters based on their similarity and dissimilarity in terms of the soil component percentages.

5. **Dendrogram Visualization**: Plot a dendrogram to visualize the hierarchical clustering results. The dendrogram will illustrate the hierarchical structure of the clusters and the distances between data points. Include a break line in the dendrogram to indicate the optimal number of clusters or the desired level of clustering.
