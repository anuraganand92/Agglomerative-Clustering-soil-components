# Hierarchial Agglomerative Clustering
<p>
<b>HAC</b> is used to group objects in clusters based on their similarity. The algorithm starts by treating each object as a singleton cluster. Next, pairs of clusters are successively merged until all clusters have been merged into one big cluster containing all objects. The result is a tree-based representation of the objects, named <b>dendrogram</b>.

<p>
In this project, HAC has been used with different linkages along with the representation of dendogram. <br>
The dataset consists of percentage of components in soil samples from different places in India.
