# Hierarchial Agglomerative Clustering
HAC is used to group objects in clusters based on their similarity. The algorithm starts by treating each object as a singleton cluster. Next, pairs of clusters are successively merged until all clusters have been merged into one big cluster containing all objects. The result is a tree-based representation of the objects, named <b>dendrogram</b>.
